**GitHub Labels**
---

We have some custom labels in Edna and I thought a little explanation of them would be handy.

**bug** - This should be added to all pull requests that are fixing a bug. Or, this should be added to issues that are reporting a bug.

**code guide** - Add this label to pull requests that are adding to the Code Guide. Or, this should be added to issues involving the Code Guide. These shouldn't include any LESS/CSS changes so merging it in shouldn't cause any issues.

**documentation** - This label should be added to pull requests that are adding to the documentation found in the `docs/` directory. Or, this should be added to issues involving the documentation. These shouldn't include any LESS/CSS changes so merging it in shouldn't cause any issues.

**duplicate** - Should be added to pull requests or issues that are a duplicate.

**enhancement** - This should be added to a pull request when it adds something new and doesn't fix a bug. Same goes for a new issue, it should be for something somebody would like to see in Edna.

**high** - This label helps specify importance, so add this to issues or pull requests when it really needs to be added.

**low** - This label helps specify importance, so add this to issues or pull requests when it really it is something to add, but isn't that high of a priority.

**medium** - This label helps specify importance, so add this to issues or pull requests when it could be added, but isn't a high importance.

**question** - When you have a question, and you create an issue, add this label. I don't see a use case where a pull request will ever need this label, but if you have a question and it comes across in a pull request, add this label.

**wontfix** -
